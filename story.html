    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>

      <strong>PREPARED FOR ALL WEATHERS </strong>

      <p>
        Sam Neale has always enjoyed being outdoors, come rain or shine, but
        would become frustrated when heavy downpours and soaking wet clothing
        put an end to his fun. So, he decided to do something about it and
        designed his very own waterproof trousers. It is typical in Britain to
        plan an outing with friends and family, only for it to be put on hold or
        not enjoyed as much as it could be due to bad weather. This especially
        applies to people who live with SCI, as sitting in wet trousers all day
        is not ideal for general comfort, let alone skin issues.

      <strong>You Need Fastfit Clothing Waterproof Trousers</strong>

      <p>
        This has happened to me many times. On one particular occasion, I went
        on a ten-minute roll to the shops but got caught in the rain and was
        soaked by the time I got home. When things like this happen, I have to
        either sit around trying to dry out or get out of the chair and onto my
        bed to change my trousers. This is not an ideal situation and if I was
        out and far from home it would put a real downer on my day. On a
        separate occasion, I went to visit a friend and the parking situation
        was not ideal, so I had to park down the road. The weather was awful
        and, even though I only had to travel two minutes from the car, I was
        drenched by the time I got to their house. As I enjoy the great
        outdoors, I was determined not to let this stop me from going out but I
        still want to keep my dignity and wear something that I feel happy and
        comfortable wearing. I do not want to have to put up with or feel
        embarrassed about my appearance.

      <strong>How We Became Fastfit Clothing</strong>

      <p>
        I did not want to miss out on events or have to stay at home because of
        the rain, etc. Using my engineering background and my mum's sewing
        skills, we came up with a prototype of waterproof trousers. It was then
        time to choose the material, so I bought samples to test. I selected the
        perfect fabric , with the ideal properties for waterproof clothing, I
        purchased a few metres of material. All I needed to do now was find a
        seamstress to make them for me. After ringing around a few places and
        not having much luck, I started to give up on the idea until I came
        across a small and local seamstress. We arranged a meeting and together
        decided there were a few things that could be improved in terms of the
        design.We did this a few times until we agreed that my prototype was fit
        for production. We now produce a range of sizes and have sold to
        customers all across the country and internationally.
